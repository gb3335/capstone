We take our clients’ brand to the next level in terms of consumer affinity, image, exposure, recognition and memorability. CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great! I learned how to use REST API, ExpressJS, ReactJS and linux programming. Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out.

Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again.

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great!

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great! I learned how to use REST API, ExpressJS, ReactJS and linux programming. Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again. DedicationI humbly dedicate this narrative report about my internship program under the Gameplan Marketing Solutions to my Family who strive hard just to let me and my brothers to be successful.THE TRAINEE Introduction Game Plan Marketing Solutions, Inc. is a strategic marketing and advertising firm that help clients achieve their goals and increase their effectiveness in the field of marketing.

Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again.

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great!

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great! I learned how to use REST API, ExpressJS, ReactJS and linux programming. Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again. DedicationI humbly dedicate this narrative report about my internship program under the Gameplan Marketing Solutions to my Family who strive hard just to let me and my brothers to be successful.THE TRAINEE Introduction Game Plan Marketing Solutions, Inc. is a strategic marketing and advertising firm that help clients achieve their goals and increase their effectiveness in the field of marketing.

Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again.

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great!

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great! I learned how to use REST API, ExpressJS, ReactJS and linux programming. Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again. DedicationI humbly dedicate this narrative report about my internship program under the Gameplan Marketing Solutions to my Family who strive hard just to let me and my brothers to be successful.THE TRAINEE Introduction Game Plan Marketing Solutions, Inc. is a strategic marketing and advertising firm that help clients achieve their goals and increase their effectiveness in the field of marketing.

Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again.

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great!

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great! I learned how to use REST API, ExpressJS, ReactJS and linux programming. Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again. DedicationI humbly dedicate this narrative report about my internship program under the Gameplan Marketing Solutions to my Family who strive hard just to let me and my brothers to be successful.THE TRAINEE Introduction Game Plan Marketing Solutions, Inc. is a strategic marketing and advertising firm that help clients achieve their goals and increase their effectiveness in the field of marketing.

Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again.

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great!

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great! I learned how to use REST API, ExpressJS, ReactJS and linux programming. Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again. DedicationI humbly dedicate this narrative report about my internship program under the Gameplan Marketing Solutions to my Family who strive hard just to let me and my brothers to be successful.THE TRAINEE Introduction Game Plan Marketing Solutions, Inc. is a strategic marketing and advertising firm that help clients achieve their goals and increase their effectiveness in the field of marketing.

Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again.

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great!

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great! I learned how to use REST API, ExpressJS, ReactJS and linux programming. Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again. DedicationI humbly dedicate this narrative report about my internship program under the Gameplan Marketing Solutions to my Family who strive hard just to let me and my brothers to be successful.THE TRAINEE Introduction Game Plan Marketing Solutions, Inc. is a strategic marketing and advertising firm that help clients achieve their goals and increase their effectiveness in the field of marketing.

Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again.

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great!

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great! I learned how to use REST API, ExpressJS, ReactJS and linux programming. Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again. DedicationI humbly dedicate this narrative report about my internship program under the Gameplan Marketing Solutions to my Family who strive hard just to let me and my brothers to be successful.THE TRAINEE Introduction Game Plan Marketing Solutions, Inc. is a strategic marketing and advertising firm that help clients achieve their goals and increase their effectiveness in the field of marketing.

Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again.

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great!

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great! I learned how to use REST API, ExpressJS, ReactJS and linux programming. Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again. DedicationI humbly dedicate this narrative report about my internship program under the Gameplan Marketing Solutions to my Family who strive hard just to let me and my brothers to be successful.THE TRAINEE Introduction Game Plan Marketing Solutions, Inc. is a strategic marketing and advertising firm that help clients achieve their goals and increase their effectiveness in the field of marketing.

Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again.

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great!

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great! I learned how to use REST API, ExpressJS, ReactJS and linux programming. Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again. DedicationI humbly dedicate this narrative report about my internship program under the Gameplan Marketing Solutions to my Family who strive hard just to let me and my brothers to be successful.THE TRAINEE Introduction Game Plan Marketing Solutions, Inc. is a strategic marketing and advertising firm that help clients achieve their goals and increase their effectiveness in the field of marketing.

Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again.

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great!

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great! I learned how to use REST API, ExpressJS, ReactJS and linux programming. Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again. DedicationI humbly dedicate this narrative report about my internship program under the Gameplan Marketing Solutions to my Family who strive hard just to let me and my brothers to be successful.THE TRAINEE Introduction Game Plan Marketing Solutions, Inc. is a strategic marketing and advertising firm that help clients achieve their goals and increase their effectiveness in the field of marketing.

Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again.

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great!

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great! I learned how to use REST API, ExpressJS, ReactJS and linux programming. Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again. DedicationI humbly dedicate this narrative report about my internship program under the Gameplan Marketing Solutions to my Family who strive hard just to let me and my brothers to be successful.THE TRAINEE Introduction Game Plan Marketing Solutions, Inc. is a strategic marketing and advertising firm that help clients achieve their goals and increase their effectiveness in the field of marketing.

Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again.

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great!

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great! I learned how to use REST API, ExpressJS, ReactJS and linux programming. Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again. DedicationI humbly dedicate this narrative report about my internship program under the Gameplan Marketing Solutions to my Family who strive hard just to let me and my brothers to be successful.THE TRAINEE Introduction Game Plan Marketing Solutions, Inc. is a strategic marketing and advertising firm that help clients achieve their goals and increase their effectiveness in the field of marketing.

Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again.

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great!

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great! I learned how to use REST API, ExpressJS, ReactJS and linux programming. Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again. DedicationI humbly dedicate this narrative report about my internship program under the Gameplan Marketing Solutions to my Family who strive hard just to let me and my brothers to be successful.THE TRAINEE Introduction Game Plan Marketing Solutions, Inc. is a strategic marketing and advertising firm that help clients achieve their goals and increase their effectiveness in the field of marketing.

Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again.

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great!

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great! I learned how to use REST API, ExpressJS, ReactJS and linux programming. Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again. DedicationI humbly dedicate this narrative report about my internship program under the Gameplan Marketing Solutions to my Family who strive hard just to let me and my brothers to be successful.THE TRAINEE Introduction Game Plan Marketing Solutions, Inc. is a strategic marketing and advertising firm that help clients achieve their goals and increase their effectiveness in the field of marketing.

Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again.

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great!

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great! I learned how to use REST API, ExpressJS, ReactJS and linux programming. Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again. DedicationI humbly dedicate this narrative report about my internship program under the Gameplan Marketing Solutions to my Family who strive hard just to let me and my brothers to be successful.THE TRAINEE Introduction Game Plan Marketing Solutions, Inc. is a strategic marketing and advertising firm that help clients achieve their goals and increase their effectiveness in the field of marketing.

Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again.

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great!

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great! I learned how to use REST API, ExpressJS, ReactJS and linux programming. Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again. DedicationI humbly dedicate this narrative report about my internship program under the Gameplan Marketing Solutions to my Family who strive hard just to let me and my brothers to be successful.THE TRAINEE Introduction Game Plan Marketing Solutions, Inc. is a strategic marketing and advertising firm that help clients achieve their goals and increase their effectiveness in the field of marketing.

Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again.

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great!

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great! I learned how to use REST API, ExpressJS, ReactJS and linux programming. Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again. DedicationI humbly dedicate this narrative report about my internship program under the Gameplan Marketing Solutions to my Family who strive hard just to let me and my brothers to be successful.THE TRAINEE Introduction Game Plan Marketing Solutions, Inc. is a strategic marketing and advertising firm that help clients achieve their goals and increase their effectiveness in the field of marketing.

Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again.

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great!

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great! I learned how to use REST API, ExpressJS, ReactJS and linux programming. Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again. DedicationI humbly dedicate this narrative report about my internship program under the Gameplan Marketing Solutions to my Family who strive hard just to let me and my brothers to be successful.THE TRAINEE Introduction Game Plan Marketing Solutions, Inc. is a strategic marketing and advertising firm that help clients achieve their goals and increase their effectiveness in the field of marketing.

Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again.

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great!

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great! I learned how to use REST API, ExpressJS, ReactJS and linux programming. Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again. DedicationI humbly dedicate this narrative report about my internship program under the Gameplan Marketing Solutions to my Family who strive hard just to let me and my brothers to be successful.THE TRAINEE Introduction Game Plan Marketing Solutions, Inc. is a strategic marketing and advertising firm that help clients achieve their goals and increase their effectiveness in the field of marketing.

Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again.

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great!

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great! I learned how to use REST API, ExpressJS, ReactJS and linux programming. Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again. DedicationI humbly dedicate this narrative report about my internship program under the Gameplan Marketing Solutions to my Family who strive hard just to let me and my brothers to be successful.THE TRAINEE Introduction Game Plan Marketing Solutions, Inc. is a strategic marketing and advertising firm that help clients achieve their goals and increase their effectiveness in the field of marketing.

Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again.

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great!

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great! I learned how to use REST API, ExpressJS, ReactJS and linux programming. Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again. DedicationI humbly dedicate this narrative report about my internship program under the Gameplan Marketing Solutions to my Family who strive hard just to let me and my brothers to be successful.THE TRAINEE Introduction Game Plan Marketing Solutions, Inc. is a strategic marketing and advertising firm that help clients achieve their goals and increase their effectiveness in the field of marketing.

Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again.

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great!

CHAPTER II NarrationIn the first day of my internship Mr. Jeric Guillermo was assigned to me as my Supervisor which is also from Bulacan State University. Since i do not have my own laptop that day, i started my day familiarizing to the environment and watching tutorial about NodeJs because that what the main tech stack they use by using a tinkerboard. They discuss to me the company and the products that they handle. Aircast, Patsy, Honeypot and WiPro. Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc. is an advertizing company which prioritize the customer. They let me familiarize and adopt thier culture and the way they code for 3days. I gained alot of experience while rendering my 500 hours to the company because they didnt treat the intern as an intern, they treat me as a fulltime employee which gave me alot of pressure. The company also offer a decent allowance. In the fourth day, they let me borrow a mac book laptop just to help them to thier minor work, because that mac book laptop is faulty. I was assigned to the Aircast product as the Operations Dev. Since our Operations team is not capable to develop, i was assigned as their developer. By the way Aircast is their company flagship product, Aircast is used to digital advertizing which you can change your campaign anytime anywhere you just need the internet. In the second week, the company finally issued to me a decent laptop so i can start my work, since im the Developer of the Operations team, i became the head of the Automations, which can generate report easily for the Operations team. I should do any request of the Operations head. The first project they gave to me is the Automation of the HoneyPot Product, by the way Honeypot is our advertizing product which help our client determine their trend or popularity in the Facebook by using thier Facebook page based on their Likes, comment, shares etc, the system must be capable of generating powerpoint report with a presentable look beacause it will be presented in our clients, plus it must have a dashboard which the operations head can see the trend of the client’s facebook page. As a team, we are not focused on our pipeline (we call project as pipeline). There are times that we need to stop developing and help our team to finish his/her pipeline if the deadline is near. As an intern i cant believe that they will let me attend some crucial client meeting which i will demo how Aircast works. Were also required to report our accomlishment daily and weekly, we must also report our next week plan so our boss will know if we still got a value to the company. Thier rules gave me a lot of pressure but also gave me a lot of experience. I learned how to talk, present, sell and negotiate to a client which is too difficult for me as an intern. Mr. Bryan Conde which is our boss likes to give pressure to his employees to see if their is really dedicated to the work. In the next day, my pipeline was change, im no longer the Automations Head. But they gave a pipeline which will rewrite the Aircast (code) and create an Aircast Template but unfortunately i was not able to accomplish that task on time since it was to hard for me. But the i accomlished the Aircast Template. There was a day that ill be in the field (Along metro manila) to replace our Aircast TV, it was a very tiring day thou. The Operations Head gave me a task, a monitoring system for Aircast, the system mush be capable of monitorng the load that was spent and the campaign playcount of the TV in a graphical representation and many more.My internship day was really hard for me since the company is using web based system and im not a web developer at all, plus their using NodeJS as thire language, but i learned it and it was great! I learned how to use REST API, ExpressJS, ReactJS and linux programming. Plus a technique on how to deal with the clients.I got a lot of fails in my work and i always receive criticism from the client and this brought down my self esteem but my supervisor said any bad things happens to me just charge it to the experience and improve, the clients will help you improve your self and be a better developer someday.Reflection on Fieldwork ExperiencesDuring my internship i experience how to communicate, sell and nogotiate to the client and work under pressure. They also sent me to a meeting where i should demo how the Aircast work and how to upload thier own campaign. There was a time that you can’t talk with your team because of the busyness of the team, all i have to do is to deal with my project on my own but its also a good practice for me and a good experience. Working With My Cooperating Officer/Immediate SuperiorMy experience with my supervisor was great, he always share to his knowledge and the way how he learn all the tech stack of the company. When i have a problem with my pipeline he’s always there to help me, even on the schema of my project. He gave me a pipeline, a system that will unified all the Operations Dashboard, and he’s always there to help me out. First of all i would like to thank the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for arranging the internship for us and the Gameplan Marketing Solutions Inc specifically Mr. Bryan Conde of Palm Solutions, my Supervisor Mr. Jeric Guilliermo and my team for accepting me as thier trainee. I am really fortunate that my 500 hours of internship was rendered to your company, i got a lot of experience and happiness. I learned many things and technique on how to be a successful person someday.I my internship i got a lot of crucial projects and im thankful that you gave me too much trust and that boosted my self esteem. My supervisor provided a huge ammount of thier time for me even thou they got a lot of projects to do.Even thou im not as productive as they are, they still treat me like im a good employee and they dont want me to go, off course its just sugar coated words. I hope someday i will have a chance to work with you guys again. DedicationI humbly dedicate this narrative report about my internship program under the Gameplan Marketing Solutions to my Family who strive hard just to let me and my brothers to be successful.THE TRAINEE Introduction Game Plan Marketing Solutions, Inc. is a strategic marketing and advertising firm that help clients achieve their goals and increase their effectiveness in the field of marketing.
